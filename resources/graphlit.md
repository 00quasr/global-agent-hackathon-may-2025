# Best Use of Graphlit

We're excited to sponsor the Global Agent Hackathon with Agno.

We will be offering credits on your paid Graphlit project for the best use of Graphlit in Agno agents.

You can use [Agno](https://docs.agno.com/tools/mcp) agents with MCP servers like Graphlit [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/graphlit/graphlit-mcp-server)

Ingest anything from Slack, Discord, websites, Google Drive, email, Jira, Linear or GitHub into a Graphlit project - and then search and retrieve relevant knowledge within your Agno agent.

Documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.) and HTML web pages will be extracted to Markdown upon ingestion. Audio and video files will be transcribed upon ingestion.

Web crawling and web search are built-in as MCP tools, with no need to integrate other tools like Firecrawl, Exa, etc. separately.

Here's a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or-QqonvcAs&t=4s) showing the capabilities of the Graphlit MCP Server with the Goose MCP client, which may give you ideas for your own AI agents.

For any questions on using the Graphlit MCP Server, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ygFmfjy3Qx) community and post on the #mcp channel.

Let us know if you need any other data connectors, or have ideas on new MCP tools that would make your Agno agent even more useful.
